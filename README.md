# Intervention-Prediction-and-Progressive-Learning-Using-Regression-Models
Implemented a grading criteria with various evaluation procedures and built temporal models to predict the best time for automatically scheduling an intervention when a student under-performs. Predicted final grade before two-thirds of the course and proved interventions scheduled using these models help significantly
